This occurs when data from external sources, such as user input or request data, is directly included in SQL statements without proper sanitation. This practice exposes the application to **SQL injection attacks**, allowing attackers to manipulate queries and potentially access or modify sensitive data. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to avoid including raw external input in SQL queries, validate all external inputs, use parameterized queries, and escape external inputs using appropriate database-specific functions.",

        "description": "**SQL Injection** vulnerability occurs when **untrusted input** is concatenated with a raw SQL query. This can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the database. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use **prepared statements**. SQLAlchemy provides tools like **TextualSQL** for safely executing raw queries with named parameters. For more complex SQL compositions, consider using **SQL Expression Language** or **Schema Definition Language**. In many cases, utilizing the **SQLAlchemy ORM** is a safer and more efficient option.",
