     ```bash
     sudo mv cybedefend-<platform> /usr/local/bin/cybedefend
     ```

4. **Run the CLI:**
   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash

After installation, you can verify that the CLI is working by running:
```bash
cybedefend --help
```

### Build from Source

If you'd prefer to build the CLI from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli.git
   cd cybedefend-cli
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o cybedefend
   ```

3. Move the binary to your `PATH`:
   ```bash
   mv cybedefend /usr/local/bin
   ```

4. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   cybedefend --version
   ```

## Configuration

### Configuration File

You can create a `config.yaml` file in one of the following locations:
- Current directory (`./config.yaml`)
- User's home directory (`$HOME/.cybedefend/config.yaml`)
- System-wide directory (`/etc/cybedefend/config.yaml`)

Example `config.yaml`:
```yaml
api_url: "https://api-preprod.cybedefend.com"
api_key: "your-api-key"
project_id: "your-project-id"
```

### Environment Variables

The CLI also supports environment variables:

- `CYBEDEFEND_API_URL`: API base URL.
- `CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY`: API key for authentication.
- `CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID`: Default project ID.

### Command-Line Flags

You can override configurations using flags:

- `--api-url`: API base URL.
- `--api-key`: API key.
- `--project-id`: Project ID.

---

## Commands

### `scan`

The `scan` command starts a new security scan for a directory or zip file.

#### Syntax

```bash
cybedefend scan [flags]
```

#### Flags

- `--dir, -d`: Directory to scan. The directory will be zipped before uploading.
- `--file, -f`: A pre-zipped file to scan. (Cannot be used with `--dir`.)
- `--project-id`: Project ID for the scan. If not provided, the value from the configuration or environment variables will be used.
- `--ci`: Enables CI/CD-friendly output. Disables colors, ASCII art, and additional formatting for plain text output.

#### Examples

1. Scan a directory:
   ```bash
   cybedefend scan --dir ./my-project --api-key your-api-key --project-id your-project-id
   ```

2. Scan a zip file:
   ```bash
   cybedefend scan --file ./my-project.zip
   ```

3. Use CI/CD-friendly mode:
   ```bash
   cybedefend scan --dir ./my-project --ci
   ```

---

### `results`

The `results` command retrieves scan results for a specific project and outputs them in the desired format.

#### Syntax

```bash
cybedefend results [flags]
```

#### Default Behavior

By default, the command fetches results in `json` format for the `sast` type and saves them to `results.json` in the current directory.

#### Flags

- `--project-id`: Project ID for which to fetch results. If not provided, the value from the configuration or environment variables will be used.
- `--type, -t`: Type of results to fetch. Options:
  - `sast`: Static Application Security Testing (default).
  - `iac`: Infrastructure as Code.
- `--page, -p`: Page number to fetch (default: `1`). Ignored if `--all` is set.
- `--all, -a`: Fetch all results across all pages.
- `--output, -o`: Format of the output file. Options:
  - `json` (default): Saves results as a JSON file.
  - `html`: Saves results as an HTML file.
  - `sarif`: Saves results in SARIF format.
- `--filename, -f`: Name of the output file (default: `results.json`).
- `--filepath`: Path to save the output file (default: `.`).
- `--ci`: Enables CI/CD-friendly output. Disables colors, ASCII art, and additional formatting for plain text output.

#### Examples

1. Fetch results in `json` format (default):
   ```bash
   cybedefend results --project-id your-project-id
   ```

2. Fetch all results in `html` format:
   ```bash
   cybedefend results --project-id your-project-id --all --output html --filename results.html
   ```

3. Fetch results in `sarif` format and save to a specific path:
   ```bash
   cybedefend results --project-id your-project-id --output sarif --filepath ./reports
   ```

4. Fetch results for the `iac` type:
   ```bash
   cybedefend results --project-id your-project-id --type iac
   ```

5. Use CI/CD-friendly mode:
   ```bash
   cybedefend results --project-id your-project-id --ci
   ```

---

## CI/CD Mode (`--ci`)

The `--ci` flag is available for both the `scan` and `results` commands. When enabled, the CLI suppresses colors, ASCII art, and other visual formatting, providing clean and minimal output suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

## Output Formats

### JSON (Default)

Results are saved in a JSON file with detailed vulnerability data, including severity, affected files, and remediation recommendations.

### HTML

Generates a human-readable HTML report summarizing vulnerabilities and their impact.

### SARIF

Generates a SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) file, commonly used for integration with IDEs and CI/CD systems.

---

## CI/CD Integration

You can integrate the CLI into CI/CD pipelines to automate security scans. Hereâ€™s an example for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install CybeDefend CLI
        run: |
          curl -L https://github.com/CybeDefend/cybedefend-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/cybedefend-linux-amd64 -o cybedefend
          chmod +x cybedefend
          sudo mv cybedefend /usr/local/bin/

      - name: Run security scan
        run: cybedefend scan --dir ./ --ci --api-key ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_API_KEY }} --project-id ${{ secrets.CYBEDEFEND_PROJECT_ID }}
```
